# Khoj - The Ultimate Guide: A Healthcare Management System

A full-stack web application designed to streamline the interaction between patients, doctors, and clinics. Built with a robust Spring Boot backend and a dynamic Vue.js frontend, Khoj provides a seamless platform for managing medical affiliations and patient histories.

## Key Features üöÄ

The platform is designed with three distinct user roles, each with a tailored dashboard and functionalities.

### For Patients üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

  * **Account Management:** Securely sign up, log in, and manage personal profiles.
  * **Flexible Search:** Find healthcare providers by first choosing a doctor and then a clinic they are affiliated with, or vice versa.
  * **Treatment History:** Access a complete history of past appointments, treatments, and diagnoses.
  * **Feedback System:** Rate and review doctors and clinics after a visit to help the community.

### For Doctors üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

  * **Affiliation Management:** Send affiliation requests to clinics and manage incoming requests (accept, reject, or suggest modifications).
  * **Personal Dashboard:** View account details, a list of affiliated clinics, and statistics on patient treatments.
  * **Patient Overview:** Keep track of all patients treated.

### For Clinics üè•

  * **Doctor Affiliation:** Send affiliation requests to doctors and manage incoming requests.
  * **Clinic Dashboard:** View clinic details, a list of all affiliated doctors, and key performance metrics.
  * **Centralized Management:** Oversee the roster of doctors available at the clinic.

## Setup and Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

  * JDK 11 or higher
  * Maven
  * Node.js and npm
  * A running instance of PostgreSQL

### Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/rohannc/Khoj-The_Ultimate_Guide.git]
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Khoj
    ```
3.  **Configure the database:**
      * Open `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
      * Update the `spring.datasource.url`, `spring.datasource.username`, and `spring.datasource.password` properties to match your database configuration.
4.  **Install dependencies and run the server:**
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    The backend will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend-directory-name
    ```
2.  **Install npm packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run serve
    ```
    The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:8081` (or another port specified in your Vue config).

## Future Improvements & Implementation Roadmap

Here are some suggested improvements to enhance the functionality and technical quality of the application.

### Core Feature Enhancements

  * **Appointment Scheduling System:**

      * **What:** The most critical next step. Allow patients to book available time slots with a doctor at a specific clinic. Doctors and clinics should be able to manage their schedules.
      * **How:** Create API endpoints for fetching available slots (`GET /api/doctors/{id}/slots`), booking an appointment (`POST /api/appointments`), and managing them. On the frontend, use a calendar component (like `v-calendar`) to display and select time slots.

  * **Real-Time Notifications:**

      * **What:** Instantly notify users about appointment confirmations, reminders, and affiliation request updates.
      * **How:** Implement **WebSockets** using Spring Boot's STOMP support. On the frontend, use a library like `SockJS` and `Stomp.js` to listen for real-time events from the server.

  * **Digital Prescription Management:**

      * **What:** Enable doctors to create and upload digital prescriptions. Patients can then view and download them from their dashboard.
      * **How:** Add a model for `Prescription` linked to a `Patient` and `Doctor`. Create a secure endpoint for file uploads (`POST /api/prescriptions/upload`) and downloads. Ensure files are stored securely (e.g., in a private S3 bucket or on a secure server volume).

  * **Admin Panel:**

      * **What:** Introduce a fourth user role (`ROLE_ADMIN`) to oversee the entire system, manage user accounts, resolve disputes, and view system-wide analytics.
      * **How:** Use Spring Security's role-based access control. Create a separate section in the Vue app for admin-only routes and components.

### Technical & Security Improvements

  * **Containerization:**

      * **What:** Package the frontend, backend, and database into containers for consistent development and easy deployment.
      * **How:** Create a `Dockerfile` for your Spring Boot application and another for your Vue.js app. Then, use a `docker-compose.yml` file to define and run the multi-container application with a single command (`docker-compose up`).

  * **Enhanced Security:**

      * **What:** Go beyond basic authentication. Implement strict validation, protect against common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF), and ensure data privacy (especially for sensitive health information).
      * **How:** In Spring Security, implement method-level security (`@PreAuthorize`) to protect business logic. Sanitize all user inputs on both the frontend and backend. Research **HIPAA** (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliance standards for handling patient data.
